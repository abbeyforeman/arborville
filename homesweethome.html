This project was inspired by <a href="https://tilde.town/">https://tilde.town/</a>
I created most of this town on <a href="https://asciiflow.com/">https://asciiflow.com/</a>
I also used some archived artwork from <a href="https://ascii.co.uk/art">https://ascii.co.uk/art</a> and <a href="https://www.asciiart.eu/">https://www.asciiart.eu/</a>(spefically the <a href="https://ascii.co.uk/art/tree">trees</a>, they're so lovely)
